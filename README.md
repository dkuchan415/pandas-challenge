Homework 4- Pandas

Based on this data, we can see a couple of clear trends for purchasing in the game "Heroes of Pymoli." 

1.) Far ore male players use this game and they spend much more overall than female players, though not as much on average as an individual female player.

2.) There are a certain few items that drive a large amount of the revenue for the game and they tend to be higher priced. Maybe the game developers could focus on developing more unique high-value items to increase revenue.

3.) The age demographic of 20-24 by far has the most purchases and revenue. Marketing efforts could be tailored to this segment based on this info.
